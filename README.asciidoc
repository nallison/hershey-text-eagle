Hershey text for Cadsoft EAGLE
==============================
Neil Allison <neil@avon-tech-solutions.co.nz>

== Overview & Use
This ULP renders text in typefaces originally created by Dr A. V. Hershey 
while working at the U. S. National Bureau of Standards.  The format of the
font data in this distribution was originally created by James Hurt and 
modified by Kamal Mostafa http://www.whence.com/hershey-fonts/

In an EAGLE board or package editor, group the text to render then run the ULP.
A dialog then allows you to specify options including:

- font
- set a wire width (stroke width) for all rendered text
- use the Ratio property to set the wire width separately for each rendered text
- slope (create simulated _italics_)
- width factor (create expanded or condensed characters)
- output layer to draw the wires
- make a package of the rendered text
- view and edit the script before executing it
- turn the UNDO function off or on while the script runs
